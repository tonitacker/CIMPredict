# CIMPredict 


## Description:
CIMPredict is used to generate Fracture Risk Values in % for A timeframe of two years upon consultation.
The CIM-blood value and the patients age are used to calculate a Fracture Risk based on a model trained by study data
that include CIM-Values and information about fractures that occured within two years.

## Features: 
CIMPredict offers a numerical risk in percent of a patient suffering an osteoporotic fracture within the next two years

## Installation:
1. Download the ZIP-File found in the releases tab and extract it to your preferred folder
2. Start CIMPredict.exe

Do not move the EXE-File out of the directory in comes in. You can create a shortcut to the exe if you wish. 
The functionality of the software relies on the data in the directory.

Similarly, provide a valid age (between 51 and 90 years).
The "Berechnen"-button is made accessible once all values are provided.
